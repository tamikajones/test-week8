What do jQuery selectors start with?

They start with $

What's the problem with this code
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$(".another-element").hide();

It will not work because you forgot to do it like this $(".my-element").hide()

What's wrong with this code:
in your html:
<div class="my-element">Hide me</div>
in your javascript:
$("#hideMe").hide();

It will noot work because there is no class for hideMe

If you have a FOLDER named lib and a FILE named app.js, why won't this link to your javascript work?
<script src="app.js"></script>

It should be <script src="lib/app.js"></script> and that is why it did not work.

What can you tell me about this: <input type="text"/> what is it? what will we be using them for?
